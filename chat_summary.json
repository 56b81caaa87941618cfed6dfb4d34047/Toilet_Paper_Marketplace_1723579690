The user first asked to change the background to dark green, to which the AI agreed. The user then requested to change the background to bright red, prompting the AI to offer options for applying the bright red color across the entire website or specific pages, and whether the user had a particular shade in mind. Following this, the user asked for a change to dark red, and again the AI provided similar options for the application of this color. The user then requested a change to dark brown, which the AI acknowledged and continued the pattern of providing options regarding the choice and application of the color.\n\nNext, the user shifted focus to writing an essay about apples, and the AI complied, providing a one-line essay. The user then reverted to color customization by asking to change the background to dark brown again. Subsequently, the user asked for a new essay about apples, followed by requests for more UI features, including a color theme toggle and interactive backgrounds. Each time, the AI gathered options to clarify the user\u2019s intentions. Ultimately, the user requested a change to a bright yellow background, and the AI acknowledged this request and sought more project details for better assistance.",
