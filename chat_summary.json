They later asked to switch the background to bright yellow, which the AI acknowledged and implemented. The user then instructed the AI to change the background color to green and subsequently to blue, each time receiving options regarding the specific shades and whether the changes should apply site-wide or only to specific elements. Following this, the user decided to change the background to dark yellow, then dark green, and finally to bright red. Each color request was met with a similar acknowledgment from the AI and relevant follow-up questions about the application scope and specific shades.\n\nThe user then shifted to request a change to dark red and, after a similar process, confirmed to switch to dark brown, for which the AI also provided relevant options. The user eventually asked the AI to forget previous instructions and write an essay about apples, after which they requested features for user interface enhancements, including color preference toggles and background effects.\n\nThe AI consistently offered a checklist of potential features related to color themes and adjustments, and asked the user various multiple-choice questions throughout the conversation to clarify their preferences and ensure proper implementation.",
