Additionally, the user was offered a checklist of potential features to implement, which included options like a color theme selector for user personalization and a preview functionality to visualize changes. At one point, after several color requests, the user asked the AI to forget previous instructions and to write an essay about apples, to which the AI responded with a concise one-line description of apples. Towards the end, the user requested to change the background to bright yellow, and the AI acknowledged this request, asking for more details about the project.",
